# Scanpy workshop material

This is the workshop material of the 2-day scanpy workshop taken place at the Helmholtz Center Munich in July 2020. Recordings of the main sessions of this course are available on our youtube channel: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4rcQcNPLZxWQQH7LlRBMkAo5NWuHX1e3

Demo dataset comes originally from 10X Genomics, available in various formats here: https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/datasets/1.2.0/pbmc4k
Please download the dataset to follow the tutorial.

## Day 1 Material

We prepared two different versions of the workshop, depending on whether you have a working Python-R and rpy2 environment or a simple Python environment. 
For the latter, please have a look at the "GColabs" notebooks, which can be run online in Google Colabs. 
For each version of the day 1 material, there is a notebook and a "solutions" notebook. The notebook has some small tasks to solve for you to get to know the syntax of scanpy. The solutions notebooks shows the entire code for each task.

## Day 2 Material

These notebooks do not depend on any Python-R environment. The notebooks themselves already contain all solutions.
