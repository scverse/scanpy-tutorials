These cells are likely under stress or are dying. When apoptotic cells are sequenced, there is less mRNA to be captured in the nucleus, and therefore fewer counts overall, and thus a higher fraction of counts fall upon mitochondrial RNA. If cells with high mitochondrial activity were found at higher counts/genes per cell, this would indicate biologically relevant mitochondrial activity."

As not all mRNA molecules in a cell are captured, there is a variability in the total number of counts detected between cells that results from both the number of molecules that were in the cells, and the sampling. As we cannot assume that all cells contain an equal number of molecules (cell sizes can differ substantially), we have to estimate the number of molecules that were initially in the cells. In fact, we don't estimate the exact number of molecules, but instead estimate cell-specific factors that should be proportional to the true number of molecules. These are called size factors. Normalized expression values are calculated by dividing the measured counts by the size factor for the cell.\n",
